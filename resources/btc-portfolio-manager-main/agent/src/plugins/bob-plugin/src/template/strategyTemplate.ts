First, review the recent messages from the conversation:

<recent_messages>
{{recentMessages}}
</recent_messages>

Here's a list of supported strategies:
<supported_strategies>
${validStrategies.join('\n')}
</supported_strategies>

Your goal is to extract the following information about the requested strategy:
1. Strategy name (must be one of the supported strategies)
2. Amount to deposit (in BTC)

Before providing the final JSON output, show your reasoning process inside <analysis> tags. Follow these steps:

1. Identify the relevant information from the user's message:
   - Quote the part of the message mentioning the strategy name
   - Quote the part mentioning the amount

2. Validate each piece of information:
   - Strategy: Check if the mentioned strategy is in the list of supported strategies
   - Amount: Attempt to convert the amount to a number to verify it's valid

3. If any information is missing or invalid, prepare an appropriate error message.

4. If all information is valid, summarize your findings.

5. Prepare the JSON structure based on your analysis.

After your analysis, provide the final output in a JSON markdown block. All fields are required. The JSON should have this structure:

\`\`\`json
{
    "strategy": string,
    "amount": number
}
\`\`\`

Remember:
- The strategy name must be a string and must exactly match one of the supported strategies
- The amount should be a number representing the BTC amount to deposit

Now, process the user's request and provide your response.
