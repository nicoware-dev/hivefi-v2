I created a new plugin for BOB strategies. BOB supports various strategies like Solv, Avalon, Bedrock, Pell, Segment, and Ionic for managing BTC assets.

I made a working BOB strategy plugin that can:

1. Recognize strategy requests using patterns like:
   - "use the Segment strategy"
   - "invest using the Solv strategy"
   - "deposit into the Bedrock strategy"
   - "switch to the Pell strategy"

2. Extract and validate strategy parameters:
   - Strategy name (must be one of: Segment, Solv, Avalon, Bedrock, Pell, or Ionic)
   - Deposit amount in BTC

3. Provide helpful information about each strategy:
   - Segment: Earn yield by providing liquidity to Segment Finance
   - Solv: Convert BTC into LSTs for additional yield opportunities
   - Avalon: Access Avalon's yield generation mechanisms
   - Bedrock: Utilize Bedrock Finance's yield optimization
   - Pell: Leverage Pell's innovative yield farming strategies
   - Ionic: Use Ionic Protocol's lending and borrowing features

4. Guide users through the strategy selection and deposit process:
   - Validate strategy name and amount
   - Provide strategy information
   - Ask for missing information (e.g., deposit amount)
   - Confirm before proceeding with the deposit


```typescript:agent/src/plugins/bob-plugin/src/actions/strategy.ts
import { Action, IAgentRuntime, Memory } from '@elizaos/core';
import { extractStrategyName } from './patterns';

export const STRATEGY_ACTION: Action = {
  name: 'BOB_STRATEGY_ACTION',
  description: 'Handles requests to use BOB strategies',
  similes: [],
  examples: [],
  handler: async (runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory) => {
    const text = message.content.text?.toLowerCase() || '';
    const strategyName = extractStrategyName(text);
    
    if (!strategyName) {
      await runtime.send('I could not determine which strategy you want to use. Please specify a valid strategy (Segment, Solv, Avalon, Bedrock, Pell, or Ionic).');
      return;
    }
    
    const strategyInfo = getStrategyInfo(strategyName);
    await runtime.send(`I'll help you use the ${strategyName} strategy.\n\n${strategyInfo}`);
    
    // Ask for deposit amount if not provided
    if (!text.includes('amount') && !text.match(/\d+(\.\d+)?/)) {
      await runtime.send('How much would you like to deposit into this strategy?');
    }
  },
  validate: async () => true
};

function getStrategyInfo(strategy: string): string {
  const info: { [key: string]: string } = {
    segment: 'The Segment strategy allows you to earn yield by providing liquidity to Segment Finance. Your BTC will be used to mint seBTC tokens.',
    solv: 'The Solv strategy uses Solv Protocol to convert your BTC into LSTs (Liquid Staking Tokens) for additional yield opportunities.',
    avalon: 'The Avalon strategy provides exposure to Avalon\'s yield generation mechanisms through their specialized vaults.',
    bedrock: 'The Bedrock strategy utilizes Bedrock Finance\'s yield optimization to generate returns on your BTC.',
    pell: 'The Pell strategy leverages Pell\'s innovative yield farming strategies to maximize returns on your BTC.',
    ionic: 'The Ionic strategy uses Ionic Protocol\'s lending and borrowing features to generate yield on your BTC deposits.'
  };
  
  return info[strategy] || 'Strategy information not available.';
}
