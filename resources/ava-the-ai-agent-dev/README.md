   // User initiates bridge transaction
   await bridgeAgent.handleEvent('BRIDGE_TOKENS', {
     token: 'USDC',
     amount: '1000000', // 1 USDC (6 decimals)
     fromChainId: 10,   // OP Mainnet
     toChainId: 8453,   // Base
     recipient: '0x...'
   });
   ```

2. **Token Bridge Flow**

   - Message is relayed through L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger
   - Tokens are minted on destination chain
   - Real-time status updates via events

3. **Status Monitoring**
   ```typescript
   // Check bridge transaction status
   await bridgeAgent.handleEvent('CHECK_BRIDGE_STATUS', {
     txHash: '0x...',
     fromChainId: 10,
     toChainId: 8453
   });
   ```

   - Secure mint/burn mechanics
   - Permission controls for bridge contracts

2. **Message Verification**
   - L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger for secure message passing
   - Cross-domain sender verification
   - Replay protection

3. **Error Handling**
   - Transaction failure recovery
   - Automatic retries with backoff
   - Detailed error reporting

#### Example Usage

```typescript
// Configure the bridge agent
const config: SuperchainConfig = {
  sourceChain: {
    id: 10,
    name: 'OP Mainnet'
  },
  destinationChain: {
    id: 8453,
    name: 'Base'
  },
  providerUrls: {
    10: 'https://mainnet.optimism.io',
    8453: 'https://mainnet.base.org'
  },
  privateKey: process.env.BRIDGE_WALLET_KEY,
  supportedTokens: {
    10: {
      'USDC': '0x...' // OP Mainnet USDC
    },
    8453: {
      'USDC': '0x...' // Base USDC
    }
  }
};

// Initialize the bridge agent
const bridgeAgent = new SuperchainBridgeAgent(eventBus, config);

// Bridge tokens
await bridgeAgent.handleEvent('BRIDGE_TOKENS', {
  token: 'USDC',
  amount: '1000000',
  fromChainId: 10,
