# HiveFi Knowledge Base

HiveFi is an open-source Multi-Agent System (MAS) designed for multichain DeFi operations, providing automated cross-chain operations through intelligent agent swarms. HiveFi combines AI technology with blockchain automation to offer efficient, secure, and scalable DeFi solutions across multiple networks including Mantle, Sonic, and MultiChain protocols.

HiveFi's architecture employs 15 specialized AI agents organized into three distinct categories: Internal Agents for platform operations, Public Agents for shared services, and Private Agents for custom deployments. Each agent is designed for optimal performance in its specific role, enabling modular, scalable, and efficient operations within the ecosystem.

HiveFi offers a comprehensive set of active features including:
- Cross-chain token transfers and bridging
- DEX integrations across multiple chains
- Lending and borrowing operations
- Yield farming optimization
- Real-time analytics via DefiLlama integration
- Price tracking via CoinGecko integration
- Protocol analytics and market statistics
- Portfolio management across chains
