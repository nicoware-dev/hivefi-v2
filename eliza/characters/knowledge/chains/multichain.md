# MultiChain Protocols Knowledge Base

MultiChain protocols refer to DeFi protocols that have deployed across multiple EVM chains, allowing users to access the same protocol interface and functionality on different blockchain networks. These protocols enable seamless cross-chain DeFi operations and provide opportunities for yield optimization across various networks.

## Protocol Overview

- **Key Protocols**: Aave, Uniswap, 1inch, Beefy, Compound
- **Supported Chains**: Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Base, Avalanche, and others
- **Interoperability**: Cross-chain deployment with consistent interfaces
- **Advantages**: Liquidity distribution, risk diversification, yield optimization

## Aave Protocol

- **Type**: Lending and borrowing protocol
- **Deployments**: Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Avalanche
- **Features**: Supply/borrow assets, variable/stable rates, flash loans
- **Governance**: AAVE token (cross-chain governance)

## Uniswap Protocol

- **Type**: Decentralized exchange (DEX)
- **Deployments**: Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Base
- **Features**: Automated market making, concentrated liquidity, swap routing
- **Versions**: v2 and v3 with different deployment strategies

## 1inch Protocol

- **Type**: DEX aggregator
- **Deployments**: Multiple EVM chains
- **Features**: Split routing, gas optimization, best price discovery
- **Advantages**: Cross-chain price comparison and optimization

## Beefy Protocol

- **Type**: Yield optimizer
- **Deployments**: Multiple EVM chains
- **Features**: Auto-compounding, strategy optimization, vault management
- **Advantages**: Cross-chain yield comparison and optimization

## Compound Protocol

- **Type**: Lending and borrowing protocol
- **Deployments**: Ethereum and other EVM chains
- **Features**: Supply/borrow assets, interest rate models
- **Governance**: COMP token
