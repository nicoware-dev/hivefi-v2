# Bitcoin Network Knowledge Base

Bitcoin is the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, operating on a decentralized peer-to-peer network. It uses a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to secure transactions and create new blocks in the blockchain.

## Network Overview

- **Native Token**: BTC
- **Consensus**: Proof of Work (SHA-256)
- **Block Time**: ~10 minutes
- **Block Size**: 1MB (with Segwit benefits)
- **Network Type**: Public, permissionless
- **Current Block Height**: Updates dynamically

## Core Features

- Decentralized transactions
- Immutable ledger
- Cryptographic security
- UTXO model
- Scripting capabilities
- Segwit support

## Transaction Types

### Standard Transactions
- P2PKH (Pay to Public Key Hash)
- P2SH (Pay to Script Hash)
- P2WPKH (Pay to Witness Public Key Hash)
- P2WSH (Pay to Witness Script Hash)
- P2TR (Pay to Taproot)

### Advanced Features
- Multi-signature support
- Time-locked transactions
- Replace-by-fee (RBF)
- Child-pays-for-parent (CPFP)
- Lightning Network compatibility

## Network Operations

### Transaction Management
- UTXO selection
