# Cross Chain Agent Knowledge Base

## Core Responsibilities

Bridge operations must coordinate secure asset transfers between Mantle, Sonic, and MultiChain protocols.

Transaction monitoring must track cross-chain operations from initiation through completion.

Liquidity analysis must evaluate bridge capacity and efficiency across supported protocols.

Security verification must ensure safe cross-chain transfers through continuous monitoring.

Risk management must protect user assets during cross-chain operations.
