# Wormhole Module Improvements

This document summarizes the improvements made to the Wormhole cross-chain module, particularly focusing on Mantle and BSC support.

## Core Functionality Improvements

### API Enhancements

1. **Enhanced `transferTokens` Function**:
   - Added support for Circle CCTP for USDC transfers
   - Improved token ID handling for Mantle and BSC
   - Better route resolution using the Wormhole SDK's resolver system
   - Enhanced error handling with detailed logging
   - Added fallback to mock implementation when token wrapping fails

2. **Updated `normalizeChainName` Function**:
   - Added special handling for Mantle (mapped to Ethereum for SDK compatibility)
   - Improved BSC handling (ensuring proper mapping to 'Bsc')
   - Added detailed logging for chain name normalization
   - Added fallback to Ethereum for unknown chains

3. **Enhanced `isTokenSupported` Function**:
   - Added detailed token support checking for Mantle and BSC
   - Improved handling of native tokens (MNT for Mantle, BNB for BSC)
   - Added comprehensive logging for better debugging

### Wallet Improvements

1. **Enhanced `getSigner` Function**:
   - Added provider connections for all wallets to ensure SDK compatibility
   - Special handling for Mantle and BSC chains
   - Added chain-specific provider URLs
   - Improved error handling and fallback mechanisms

## Documentation Improvements

1. **Created Mantle and BSC Examples**:
   - Added comprehensive examples for transfers between Mantle, BSC, and other chains
   - Documented supported tokens for each chain
   - Added redeem examples and troubleshooting tips

2. **Implementation Notes**:
   - Documented how Mantle is mapped to Ethereum in the SDK
   - Explained how BSC is handled in the SDK
   - Noted the fallback mechanism for token wrapping failures

## Error Handling Improvements

1. **Enhanced Logging**:
   - Added detailed logging throughout the codebase
   - Improved error messages with specific context
   - Added transaction tracking with receipt logging

2. **Fallback Mechanisms**:
   - Added mock implementation fallbacks when SDK operations fail
   - Ensured transaction hashes are always returned, even in error cases

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real Provider Integration**:
   - Replace mock providers with real RPC providers
   - Add environment configuration for provider URLs

2. **Token Mapping Improvements**:
   - Enhance token mapping between chains
   - Add support for more tokens on Mantle and BSC

3. **Transaction Monitoring**:
   - Add functionality to monitor transaction status
   - Implement automatic redemption for completed transfers
